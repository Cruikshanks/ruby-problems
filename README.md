# Ruby Problems

[Another(!) repository of technical tests](https://github.com/Cruikshanks/tech-tests) I've attempted for future referral.

## Pre-requisites

You'll need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed (ideally the latest version available) plus the [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) gem.

## Installation

Clone the repository, copying the project into a working directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cruikshanks/ruby-problems.git
cd ruby-problems
```

Then run the following command

```bash
bundle install
```

[Bundler](http://bundler.io/) will download everything needed for the project. Once complete you're good to go!

## Execution

To keep things simple just run the scripts directly, for example, `ruby problems/two_sum.rb`.
